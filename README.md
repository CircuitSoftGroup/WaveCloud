This repository is the frontend UI you see on Wave Cloud, licensed under CC0. This project is a "component" of ownCloud, which we then integrate in the backend repo, a fork of ownCloud.

This page also serves as our issue tracker, although pull requests should be submitted in their respective place.

For the backend, checkout [the code that powers Wave Cloud](https://github.com/CircuitSoftGroup/WaveCloudCore).
